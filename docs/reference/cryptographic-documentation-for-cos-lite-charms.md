# Cryptographic documentation for COS-Lite charms

This document provides cryptographic documentation for the COS-Lite bundle.
Its purpose is to track the exposure of charm code to cryptographic attack vectors. 

What is not included in this document and regarded as out of scope:

- Workload code (refer to the workloads' cryptographic documentation)
- Data at rest encryption

The COS-Lite charms have a very similar exposure. Unless specified otherwise in the charm's own documentation, this cryptographic documentation applies to all.

## Usage of cryptographic technology

COS-Lite charm code uses cryptographic technology for mainly two purposes:

- enabling TLS communication between their workloads
- securing admin login to their workloads

### Cryptographic use internal to cos-lite

COS-Lite charm code can use cryptographic technology to generate a private key to sign their TLS certificate requests. They do so via the [tls-certificates-interface](https://github.com/canonical/tls-certificates-interface) which in turn uses the [cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) Python library and Juju secrets to exchange data with the CA.

Also, charms that deal with large configuration files use sha256 to efficiently detect diffs in them.

### Cryptographic use in how cos-lite communicates externally

COS-Lite charm users use passwords generated by charm code that depends on Python's [`secrets`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html) module. No configuration is exposed to the user.
These passwords secure admin login to the user-facing server provided by the workload. For example, in [`grafana-k8s`](https://github.com/canonical/grafana-k8s-operator/blob/main/src/charm.py#L1289).

Additionally, charms supporting BasicAuth {ref}`such as Traefik <how_to_enable_basicauth>` accept a `<username>:<hashed-password>` configuration option by which the user can configure basic authentication. The supported hashing algorithm are MD5, SHA1, or bcrypt [according to the official documentation](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/http/basicauth). Also following the official guidelines, we recommend cloud admins to use `htpasswd` for hashing the password and formatting the configuration string.

## List of packages and cryptographic tech used

- to generate private keys for setting up TLS communication: the `rsa.generate_private_key` function from the [`rsa` package](https://stuvel.eu/software/rsa/). They use the following parameters (hardcoded, not user-configurable):
  - `key_size = 2048`
  - `public_exponent = 65537`
- to generate admin passwords for user admin login: the  [`secrets`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html) module from the Python standard library. See for example: [usage in grafana](https://github.com/canonical/grafana-k8s-operator/blob/main/src/charm.py#L1289).
