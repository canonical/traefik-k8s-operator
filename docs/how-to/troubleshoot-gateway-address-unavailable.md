Whenever Traefik is used to ingress your Kubernetes workloads, you risk encountering the dreaded "Gateway Address Unavailable" message. In this article, we'll go through what you can do to remediate it.

```{warning}
In this article, we will assume that you are running MicroK8s on either a bare-metal or virtual machine. If your setup differs from this, parts of the how-to guide may still apply, although you will need to tailor the exact steps and commands to your setup.
```

## Requirements

- You have ran `juju trust <traefik> --scope=cluster`
- The [metallb microk8s addon](https://microk8s.io/docs/addon-metallb) is enabled.
- Traefik's service type is `LoadBalancer`.
- An external IP address is assigned to Traefik.

## The metallb addon isn't enabled

Check with:

```bash
microk8s status -a metallb
```

If it is disabled, you can enable it with:

```bash
IPADDR=$(ip -4 -j route get 2.2.2.2 | jq -r '.[] | .prefsrc')
microk8s enable metallb:$IPADDR-$IPADDR
```

This command will fetch the IPv4 address assigned to your host, and hand it to MetalLB as an assignable IP. If the address range you want to hand to MetalLB differs from your host ip, alter the `$IPADDR` variable to instead specify the range you want to assign, for instance `IPADDR=10.0.0.1-10.0.0.100`.

## No external IP address is assigned to the Traefik service

Does the Traefik service have an external IP assigned to it? Check with:

```bash
JUJU_APP_NAME="traefik"
kubectl get svc -A -o wide | grep -E "^NAMESPACE|$JUJU_APP_NAME"
```

## No available IP in address pool

This frequently happens when: 

- Metallb has only one IP in its range but you deployed two instances of Traefik, or Traefik is forcefully removed (`--force --no-wait`) and then a new Traefik app is deployed immediately after.
- The [`ingress`](https://microk8s.io/docs/ingress) addon is enabled. It's possible that NGINX from the ingress addon has claimed the ExternalIP. Disable NGINX and re-enable metallb.

Check with:

```bash
kubectl get ipaddresspool -n metallb-system -o yaml && kubectl get all -n metallb-system
```

You could add more IPs to the range:

```
FROM_IP="..."
TO_IP="..."
microk8s enable metallb:$FROM_IP-$TO_IP
```

## Juju reverted the service type to `ClusterIP`

Juju controller cycling may cause the type to revert from `LoadBalancer` back to `ClusterIP`. 

Check with:

```bash
kubectl get svc -A -o wide | grep -E "^NAMESPACE|LoadBalancer"
```

If Traefik isn't listed (it's not `LoadBalancer`), then recreate the pod to have it retrigger the assignment of the external IP with `kubectl delete` . It should be `LoadBalancer` when Kubernetes brings it back.

## Integration tests pass locally but fail on GitHub runners

This used to happen when the GitHub runners were at peak usage, making the already small `2cpu7gb` runners run even slower.
As much of a bad answer as this is, the best response may be to increase timeouts or try to move CI jobs to internal runners.

<!-- ### Using the `external_hostname` config option -->

## Verification

Verify that the Traefik Kubernetes service now has been assigned an external IP:

```{terminal}
microk8s.kubectl get services -A

NAMESPACE         NAME                     TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP                 PORT(S)
cos               traefik                  LoadBalancer   10.152.183.130   10.70.43.245                80:32343/TCP,443:30698/TCP   4d3h
                                                                                👆 - This one!
                                                                                
```

Verify that Traefik is functioning correctly by trying to trigger one of your ingressed paths. If you have COS Lite deployed, you may check that if works as expected using the Catalogue charm:

```
curl http://<TRAEFIKS_EXTERNAL_IP>/<YOUR_MODEL_NAME>-catalogue/
```

For example, `curl http://10.70.43.245/cos-catalogue/`.

This command should return a long HTML code block if everything works as expected.
