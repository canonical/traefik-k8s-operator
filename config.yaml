      The DNS name to be used by Traefik ingress.
      If unspecified, the gateway ingress ip address will be used, e.g,

  routing_mode:
    description: |
      The routing mode allows you to specify how Traefik going to generate
      routes on behalf of the requesters.

      Valid values are "path" and "subdomain".

      With the "path" routing mode, Traefik will use its externally-visible url,
      and create a route for the requester that will be structure like:

      `<external_url>/<requester_model_name>-<requester_application_name>-<requester-unit-index>`

      For example, an ingress-per-unit provider with `http://foo` external URL,
      will provide to the unit `my-unit/2` in the `my-model` model the
      following URL:

      `http://foo/my-model-my-unit-2`

      With the "subdomain" routing mode, Traefik will use its externally-visible url,
      and create a route for the requester that will be structure like:

      `<protocol>://<requester_model_name>-<requester_application_name>-<requester-unit-index>.<external_hostname>:<port>/`

      For example, an ingress-per-unit provider with `http://foo:8080` external URL,
      will provide to the unit `my-unit/2` in the `my-model` model the following URL:

      `http://my-model-my-unit-2.foo:8080`
